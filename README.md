# 🧠 Intro Java Projects (COMP 1131 - TRU)

Welcome! This repository contains beginner-level Java projects and exercises completed during my first semester of Computer Science at Thompson Rivers University (TRU).

> 📍 **Goal:** Build a strong foundation in Java programming concepts — starting from basic syntax to object-oriented design — and show consistent growth through clear, well-organized code.

## 📝 Notes

This repository is part of my learning journey as a Computer Science student at TRU. I’m using it to:

- Practice and reinforce core programming concepts
- Document steady progress over time
- Showcase clean and organized code as I grow

All code is written from scratch unless noted otherwise.
