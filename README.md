# Intro to Java Projects — COMP 1131 (TRU)

This repository contains my first Java programming projects, completed during COMP 1131 – *Computer Programming I* at Thompson Rivers University. It serves as a record of my learning as I move from basic syntax to object-oriented programming concepts in Java.

> 🚀 This repo tracks my Java learning journey — one small project at a time.

## 📝 Notes

This repository is part of my learning journey as a Computer Science student at TRU. Each folder represents a foundational concept in Java programming.

I’m using this repo to:

- Reinforce course concepts through practice
- Showcase clean and readable code
- Track my growth and learning milestones

All code is written from scratch unless stated otherwise.
